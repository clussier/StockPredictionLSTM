# StockPredictionLSTM
Using a recurrent neural network in order to predict the future price of Google stock trained on 5 years of historical price data. I implement a stacked LSTM with dropout regulation to avoid overfitting using tensorflow, keras, and python.
I completed this project as part of the "Deep Learning A-Z: Hands-on ANN"
